# DodgeBlock-Open
The public open-source version of Dodgeblock  
  
Due to the nature of secret codes, I cannot release all of the code, but I can put all of it except for that part. Feel free to check out my horrible coding and submit pull requests if you feel up to the task. If you compile the game from source you _wall not have access to secret codes_ and _will not be eligible for the leaderboard._ But you can still have fun.
